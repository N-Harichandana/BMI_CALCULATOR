# BMI CALCULATOR

This Flutter app allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. BMI is a simple calculation that helps determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users  can input their weight in kilograms and height in centimeters to receive their BMI score and a corresponding health status category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).The app aims to promote awareness of healthy body weight and encourage users to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
